# runge-kutta
2nd year computational physics exercise

I used the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve the equation of motion of a rocket orbiting the Earth. The effect of the timestep on the accuracy of the orbit was examined. This was extended to include the Moon, such that the rocket makes a burn and enters the Moon's orbit.
